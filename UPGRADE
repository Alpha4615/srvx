Upgrading from srvx-1.2
-----------------------

Copy srvx.conf and your database files from your srvx-1.2 directory to
your srvx-1.3 directory.

Look over your srvx.conf and compare it to srvx.conf.example from
srvx-1.3.  Add any new settings you want to.

If you are using HelpServ, move the "helpserv" subsection from the
"services" section to the "modules" section.  Make sure you enable
the HelpServ module; see Q6 and Q8 in the FAQ.

You must update command bindings, because several common commands
moved in srvx-1.3.  If you have not added many custom bindings, the
easiest way to do this is to delete the "modcmd" section of srvx.db
(if you are using the "mondo" database layout) or delete modcmd.db (if
you are not using "mondo"); when you start srvx after doing that, it
will set up all the standard bindings.

If you have added many custom bindings, the following commands should
be bound to services:
        Service Name	Suggested Name	Binding
        ------------    --------------  -------
        NickServ
        ChanServ
        OpServ
(The above list is known to be incomplete.)
